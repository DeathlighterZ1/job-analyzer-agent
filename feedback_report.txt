Suggestions:
 It is essential to include a professional headshot as part of your CV unless you have a compelling reason not to. It is usual to include a passport-size photo in the upper right corner of the CV in Pakistan. This is optional in some countries and unlikely to be required for an international position. However, it is worth checking the requirements if you are applying for a position in Pakistan. 

The CV text you provided is also lacking a professional summary statement that outlines the candidate's greatest accomplishments and skills. This paragraph should be impactful and concise, conveying the candidate's unique value proposition. 

It is generally recommended to include keywords relating to soft skills in a CV as well, such as teamwork, communication, and time management. 

The absence of a qualifications section where the candidate could list their relevant technical skills and certifications is another omission worth noting. This could include languages, programming languages, software, or other technical skills that complement the core skills presented in the "Top Skills" section. 

Finally, the CV should be formatted consistently with headings and subtitles, appropriate fonts and spacing, and precise and professional language. 

Hope this helps! Let me know if you would like me to make any specific adjustments to the text you provided or if you would like me to generate a new CV template that is tailored to your goals and targeted at an audience in Pakistan, in case you are applying for a local or international position.
